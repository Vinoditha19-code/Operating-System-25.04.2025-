Question_01:
* Creates three main directories (CSC2244, Marks, and Exam) on the Desktop.
* Adds structured subfolders (practical, theory, and Exam papers) under CSC2244.
* Generates appropriate files in each subdirectory:
      txt file with some text,
      Placeholder .docx and .pptx files.
* Creates two Excel files (Icae.xlsx and FinalMarks.xlsx) and moves them into the Marks directory.
* Copies the Marks directory into the Exam directory.
* Hides the Exam directory using the attrib +h command, which makes it invisible in File Explorer unless hidden items are shown.

Question_02:
* The first AWK command filtered and displayed only students with a GPA greater than 3.5.
* The second AWK command computed the average GPA of all students in the file (excluding the header).
* This demonstrates how AWK can efficiently process CSV files for filtering and basic calculations on the Linux command line.

Question_03:
* This shell script compares two input strings based on their lengths. It reads two strings from the user, calculates their lengths, and then:
    If the first string is longer, it prints that the first string is larger.
    If the second string is longer, it prints that the second string is larger.
    If both strings have the same length, it prints that they are of equal length.
* This helps determine which of the two strings is longer or if they are equal in length.
